## Summary
A single page web application pulling data from a Marvel API built using React. I used a makeRequest to get the data from the API and parsed the data into a JSON object. Click on a comic book cover and see the description and a read more button that links to the comic book page on the Marvel website. If you clone or download the project, remember to use your Marvel API key from the Marvel Developer website in place of the variable `apikey`.  

## Languages and tools used:
- React JS
- CSS3
- SASS
- Webpack
- Marvel API Key
